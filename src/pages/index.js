      <p className={styles.biography}>I live in London and work at bp plc as a graduate software engineer building tech to help accelerate the energy transition.
      I was born in Ireland and after studying a BEng in Mechanical Engineering and an MSc in Software Development from Queen's University Belfast I jumped across the water. I have developed a broad interest and experience in Machine Learning, Cloud and Data Science and I enjoy building in these areas.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.biography}>
        I am really keen to develop skills in the area of startups, product management and technology strategy.
        I love talking to people with fresh ideas and a good book recommendation!
